# Voice Controlled Car

This is the link for the project: [https://www.hackster.io/aqarrout/voice-controlled-car-ee1464]

**Project Description** : This bot works on Voice Recognition Technology. 

The circuit includes Arduino UNO Board, HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth Module, L293D Motor Driver IC, a pair of DC Geared Motors of 200 RPM and a 9V Battery. 

The voice Commands are processed by phone, and speech-to-text conversion is done within the app using Googleâ€™s speech-recognition technology. Text is then sent to the receiver side via Bluetooth. Text received via Bluetooth is forwarded to Arduino Uno board, Arduino controls the movements of the robot accordingly in forward, backward, Turning Right, Turning Left & Stop if the text is a matching string. Here, the transmitter is a Android smartphone with application connected to a bluetooth transceiver, on the reciever side is this bluetooth HC-05 connected to Arduino Uno board which is further connected to L293D Motor Driver controlling Left motor and right motor.
